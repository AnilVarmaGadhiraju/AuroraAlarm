Welcome to AuroraAlarm's documentation!
=======================================

This is a documentation for AuroraAlarm project. This documentation is not organized in a classical way, but as a report.
This project was developed as a part of Design of Dynamic Web Systems course, taught at the Lule√• University of Technology, Sweden.

Instead of a blog we have been using Github's issue tracking system. We have commented what it has been done, what we
are going to do and where we have problems. You can find issues here::
