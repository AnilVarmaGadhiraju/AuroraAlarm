Discussion and Evaluation
=========================

Components

The system must include the following:
Backend (server-part) that stores data persistently and efficiently.
A clearly defined and documented API for communication with the backend.
Easy to use frontend that allows for upload of data via the web and allows the user to see all data stored in an efficient and "nice" way.
All communication with the backend should be via the API from bullet 2.
A simplified but well documented example application that communicates with the backend to allow for new users to create new types of applications using your backend.
Security on the "right level". It is recommended that a modern security scheme is used where users can login using alternative services like e.g. Google or FaceBook.
You should understand how the security part works and be able to motivate why your solution is secure.
The system should utilize modern HTML5-technologies of your choice.

Deployment
The system should be deployed in the cloud and be publically available.
Some examples of free cloud services include: Amazon EC2, Heroku and Google App Engine.

Bonus Parts

User administration - add, remove, edit users.
Data administration - interfacing databases, editing data via separate graphical interface.
Statistics over usage (tip: Google Analytics)
Connections to social media, e.g. FaceBook and Google+.
Integrate "cool" other APIs
Make the system extra attractive but remember that usability is the most important part
Use your imagination - do that little extra...
