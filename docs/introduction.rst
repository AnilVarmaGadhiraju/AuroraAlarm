Problem
-------
We are exchange students here in Lule√• and we have already realized that here you can see an extraordinary natural phenomenon,
called aurora borealis or northern lights. When we saw it for the first time, we were impressed. But after a couple of months living
here in northern Scandinavia, we have realized that it is very hard to know, when aurora is visible. You can miss it very easy.
We were searching for different applications which can notify you, when aurora is active, but we were not able to find it.
That is why we decided to develop a web application which can help every aurora enthusiast to never miss northern lights anymore.


Project description
-------------------
AuroraAlarm is a simple web application for monitoring auroral activity and to inform users, when Aurora
can be seen at their current location. The application consists of four main parts:

1. **Aurora Activity** - check history and forecast of auroral activity
2. **Aurora Alarms** - set aurora notifications
3. **Aurora Gallery** - upload and share the nicest images of aurora
4. **Aurora Map** - check where you can see the nicest aurora

Use cases
---------
We have provided a few use cases, what a user can do with AuroraAlarm application:

1. A user can check, when Aurora was active in the past and when it will be active in the future (up to five days).
2. A user can set a threshold for auroral activity. When auroral activity exceeds this threshold, user receives an email notification.
3. A user can notify others, if he/she can see aurora activity. The user has to set up his/her current location. All other users who wants to receive this kind of alarms are notified as soon as possible.
4. A user can upload an image of aurora and set location, where the image was taken.
5. A user can search over the map, where are collected different aurora images. Here a user can see, where you can see the nicest aurora.
6. A user can sign up with Facebook or Google+ account.
