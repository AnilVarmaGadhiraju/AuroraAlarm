AuroraAlarm
===========
AuroraAlarm is a simple web application for monitoring auroral activity. It consists of four main parts: 

1. **Aurora Activity** - check history and forecast of auroral activity
2. **Aurora Alarms** - set aurora notifications
3. **Aurora Gallery** - upload and share the nicest images of aurora
4. **Aurora Map** - check where you can see the nicest aurora

The basic idea of the application is that you will never miss aurora activity near your location. You can sign up for notifications and when aurora will be active, you will receive an email. At the moment it works just in Europe. 

This project is a part of Design of Dynamic Web Systems course at Lule√• University of Technology.

Current stable version is accessible at Heroku: http://aurora-alarm.herokuapp.com/
