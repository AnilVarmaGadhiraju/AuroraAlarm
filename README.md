AuroraAlarm
===========

AuroraAlarm is a simple web application for monitoring auroral activity. It consists of three main parts: 

1. Aurora Activity - history and forecast of auroral activity
2. Aurora Alarms - set aurora notifications
3. Aurora Gallery - upload and share the nicest images of aurora

The basic idea of the application is that you will never miss aurora activity near your location. You can sign up for notifications and when aurora will be active, you will receive an email. At the moment it works just in Europe.
