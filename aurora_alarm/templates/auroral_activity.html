                                <p>This chart represents the history of Auroral Activity. For each day, the forecast from the <a href="http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast/">Geophysical Institute of University of Alaska Fairbanks</a> is displayed. This allow you to estimate how often the auroral activity reaches a given treshold. Please note that those values are only previsions, and that your observation may differ.

                                <p>This table explains the different auroral activity levels, with a geographical indication of where the aurora should be visible from. Note that seeing an aurora depends on many factors, not only the aurora activity level. The aurora will be easier to see in complete dark (night, away from city lights) and by a clear weather.
